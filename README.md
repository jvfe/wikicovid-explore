# wikicovid-explore

Just exploring what sort of data about COVID we can get from Wikidata and seeing a way to visualize it, as a way to introduce wikidata to other people. 

Most of the SPARQL queries I'm using were made by [Egon Willighagen](https://github.com/egonw/SARS-CoV-2-Queries) so thanks a lot to him.
